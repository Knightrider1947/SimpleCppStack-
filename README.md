Enhanced Stack Implementation in C++
This repository presents an enhanced version of a Stack class implemented in C++. The Stack data structure is designed to operate on the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. This improved version introduces a more streamlined approach to stack management, including dynamic memory allocation for stack storage, and basic stack operations such as push, pop, and display. It is a versatile example for educational purposes, demonstrating object-oriented programming concepts in C++.

Features
Dynamic Stack Size: The stack size can be set at runtime, providing flexibility in how much data the stack can hold.
Memory Management: The class handles dynamic memory allocation and deallocation internally, ensuring efficient use of resources.
Stack Operations: Implements essential stack operations including push() for adding items, pop() for removing the top item, isEmpty() to check if the stack is empty, isFull() to check if the stack is full, and display() to print all elements in the stack.
